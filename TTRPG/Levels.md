 <h2> Optional Level 0 for New Players </h2>
      To ease new players into the XP system and gameplay, consider starting them at Level 0. At this stage, characters don’t have access to skills and begin with only basic equipment.

You can run a few simple, low-difficulty adventures designed to introduce core mechanics and roleplaying concepts. As they complete these, award small amounts of XP (typically between 3 and 8).

Once they’ve earned enough XP to reach Level 1, they level up as normal — but without resetting their XP. Any XP earned during Level 0 carries over and contributes toward reaching Level 2. This means some players might reach Level 2 quickly, depending on how much they accomplished during their Level 0 experience.

<h2>Milestone</h2>
Instead of using Experience points you can instead choose when to level up your party using milestones. This removes the need to keep track of experience points and gives you more freedom.
