## History

Founded by [[Gfuru Saltfurr]] approximately 170 years ago while exploring the islands searching for rare alchemical ingredients that grow in the shallow waters of archipelagos. He led an expedition into the jungles on the largest island, where a large fresh-water oasis was found. He decided to establish a colony, returning to [[Thibis]] to bring over any settlers who wished to join him.

Involved in the [[War of the Red Waters]] against the [[Tabaxi]] homeland of [[Thibis]], over 80 years ago.
