# Species Details

## Siren Racial Details

**Siren’s Song:** You may use your singing to lure someone towards you. To do this, you must make a Performance check. The opposing creature must then
make a Wisdom saving throw to resist you. If your Performance Check is higher than their saving throw, They gain the Charmed Condition.

**Tidal Movement** You are proficient in the Performance Skill.

**Siren’s Tail:** Gain a swim speed, you also have a tail when in water

**Amphibious:** In both your Human and Siren form, you may breathe both air and water.

## Dhampir Lineage

**Creature Type:** Humanoid

**Size:** Small or Medium

**Speed:** 35 feet, Climb equal to your walking speed

**Size**. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.

**Ancestral Legacy.** If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and
any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that
darkness as shades of gray.

**Deathless Nature.** You don’t need to breathe.

**Spider Climb.** You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, at 3rd level, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and
upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

**Vampiric Progeny.** Although you are a living creature, the energy of Mabar suffuses your body. When you are the target of a non-necromancy spell that
would normally cause its target to regain hit points, you do not regain any hit points and instead suffer radiant damage equal to the amount of hit points
the spell would normally cause its target to regain. Likewise, when you would normally be dealt necrotic damage, you do not take any necrotic damage
from the attack or effect that dealt it and instead regain a number of hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage the attack or effect would
normally deal.

**Captivating.** You inherit some of the dark charm of your vampiric parent. You have proficiency with the Persuasion skill.

**Blood Thirst.** You can drain blood and life energy from a  humanoid creature, Gain a Bite attack that deals 1 Piercing damage and 1d6 Necrotic damage. This is considered a light weapon.The necrotic damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). For every three days you do not successfully deal 1 or more points of necrotic damage with this attack, you suffer one level of exhaustion. Levels of exhaustion gained this way cannot be removed by rest or magic; they can only be removed by dealing necrotic damage with this attack. Doing so instantly removes one level of exhaustion gained this way for every point of necrotic damage it deals (but not levels of exhaustion gained by any other means).

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or
whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one additional language of your choice.
